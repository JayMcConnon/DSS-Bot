:::tip Read more about the changelog.
I have a private repository that the bot code lives in, and to maintain a publicly available
changelog that is easy for you guys to access, actually took a little more work than you would think because of this.
If you happen to stumble across this documentation because of interest in this and want to read more about how I achieved this, you can visit my article on 
[dev.to](https://dev.to/jaymcconnon/maintaining-a-public-changelog-from-a-private-github-repo-with-gren-and-vuepress-eli).
