# How to get help

## Problems with the bot?

### Discord

If you encounter any serious problems whilst using the bot, you can join the [official discord](https://discord.gg/J3ufCA2).

If you have an error that is either sensitive or very complicated, then you can PM Jay or another member of the discord marked as `support`.

### Github issues page

There is a public [issues](https://github.com/JayMcConnon/DSS-Bot/issues) page on github. This is a great place to be able to write
a detailed and accurate report of what is happening when you are encoutering your issue. It will help allot with trying to find a fix.
 
If there is found to be an error that needs
to be fixed with a patch, it can be moved into the private workspace to be worked on.


## General use of the bot 

You can use the search bar above to find help on anything to do with the bot.

## If you are a discord server manager

There is a command built into the bot to request help directly in your server. Use of this is restricted to the use of people with the `MANAGE_GUILD`
permission, that will generate an invite to your discord and DM it to me. If you are asking for help that requires I debug
something inside of your discord server, you can use this to generate this one time use invitation that is sent directly into the official discord.

 Read more about the [Invite Developer command](/commands/general.html#invite-developer-to-discord).

Developers and staff have access to a range of helpful things to help debug getting the bot setup to query your servers.
